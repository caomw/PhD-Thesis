QuickHull3D: A Robust 3D Convex Hull Algorithm in Java
 </td>
 <td>
This is a 3D implementation of QuickHull for Java, based on the original paper by Barber, Dobkin, and Huhdanpaa and the C implementation known as qhull. The algorithm has O(n log(n)) complexity, works with double precision numbers, is fairly robust with respect to degenerate situations, and allows the merging of co-planar faces. </td>

 �lfred XML parser from Microstar
 </td>
 <td>
 According to Microstar, AElfred is "a small, fast, DTD-aware Java-based XML parser, especially suitable for use in Java applets. We've designed AElfred for Java programmers who want to add XML support to their applets and applications without doubling their size: AElfred consists of only two core class files, with a total size of about 26K, and requires very little memory to run. There is also a complete SAX (Simple API for XML) driver available in this distribution for interoperability."

XPP
 </td>
 <td>
 Xml Pull Parser (in short XPP) is a streaming pull XML parser and should be used when there is a need to process quickly and efficiently all input elements (for example in SOAP processors). Pull parsing is just one level up from tokenizing XML (and that is actually how XPP2 default implementation is done). This means that XPP is representing the simplest way of processing XML that you can get (working with tokenizer would be even lower level but is not simple and most of applications would be much more complex to extract useful information from XML tokens ...).
